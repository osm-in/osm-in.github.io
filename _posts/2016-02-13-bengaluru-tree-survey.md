We will take a walk in the neighbourhood using printed maps from [fielpapers](http://learnosm.org/en/mobile-mapping/field-papers/) to locate trees and then update the details onto OSM. We will make a simple poster of the data collected at the end. You can track the live data updates [here](http://overpass-turbo.eu/s/eoA).

Event is free and open to all ages. Bring your laptop, cap, comfortable footwear and a pen or pencil.
